"""Parallel-drafting draft attention on npu_fused_infer_attention_sink.

A DSpark/DFlash draft reads a KV length that is only known on device: it is the
scheduled length minus the tokens this step rejected, and the rejection count is
produced by the verify kernel. The ordinary FIA entry point wants that length as
a host-side list, so serving it costs a device-to-host sync in every draft
metadata build. The sink operator takes the lengths as device tensors and does
its tiling on AICPU, so the draft keeps them where they already are.

This lives in its own backend rather than as a flag on the shared one because
the two differ in what they read, not merely in which kernel they call: the
builder here leaves the host-side sequence lists unset, and every consumer
downstream -- the metadata, the forward, the full-graph replay path that skips
layers without a `seq_lens_list` -- follows from that one decision. As a branch
inside the shared backend, each of those was a separate condition to keep in
sync, and enabling the operator was process-global, so one sliding-window layer
anywhere turned into a hard failure. Which layers get this is now settled once,
where every other Ascend backend is settled: in `NPUPlatform.get_attn_backend_cls`.

A plain subclass, not `subclass_attention_backend`: that helper builds a variant
of whatever backend was selected underneath, which is what ChunkedLocalAttention
and the encoder-only wrapper need. There is exactly one backend underneath this
one -- the sink operator rejects Ascend310P outright -- so naming it directly is
both simpler and more honest about the coupling.
